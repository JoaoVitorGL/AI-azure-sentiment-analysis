Product Review: SmartHome Speaker X.
I recently bought the SmartHome Speaker X, and my experience has been both good and frustrating.
On the positive side, the sound quality is impressive, with deep bass and clear vocals. It also has a sleek design that fits well in any room. The voice recognition is quite accurate, even when there’s background noise.
However, the setup process was frustrating—the app crashed several times, and it took much longer than expected to connect the speaker to Wi-Fi. Also, the AI assistant is noticeably slower compared to other smart speakers.
Overall, it’s a good device with great potential, but it still needs software improvements to be truly outstanding.
